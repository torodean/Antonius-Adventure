\chapter{Introduction}

This document outlines the core concept and mechanics for an idle adventure game. The game focuses on building and managing a garrison where players recruit adventurers and send them on missions. These missions, which vary in duration (e.g., short, medium, and long), provide rewards such as currency, items, and the possibility of recruiting new adventurers.

Players can construct and upgrade various buildings within the garrison, each offering specific functionalities. Example building types include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Crafting buildings for producing weapons, armor, or consumable items.
    \item Resource production buildings, such as farms or forges, which generate materials used in crafting or for mission preparation.
    \item Support buildings that improve adventurer performance, provide training, or increase mission success rates.
\end{itemize}

Adventurers can be equipped with items, trained, or provided with consumables from the garrison buildings to increase their effectiveness in missions. As the player progresses, more adventurers, buildings, and missions become available, creating a gameplay loop of resource management, building upgrades, and mission execution.

This general framework serves as the basis for further development and design decisions regarding specific features, balancing, and progression mechanics.
